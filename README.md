# Jupyter Conda Lab

This repository contains a Docker file to create a container that has
conda installed and uses Jupyter notebooks. It also has installed
node, npm, ijavascript and some JS dependencies.

I use the Dockerfile to create containers in which I can test my Python
and JavaScript code taking advantage of Jupyter's features.
